\item{r}{Number of blocks (full resolvable replicates).}

\item{l}{Number of locations. By default \code{l = 1}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for each location. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) Names for each location.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

}
\value{
A list with information on the design parameters.

Data frame with the square lattice design field book.

\description{
It randomly generates a square lattice design across locations.
