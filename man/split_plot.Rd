\item{sp}{Number of sub plots per whole plot, as an integer or a vector.}

\item{reps}{Number of blocks (full replicates).}

\item{type}{Option for CRD or RCBD designs. Values are \code{type = 1} (CRD) or \code{type = 2} (RCBD). By default \code{type = 2}.}

\item{l}{Number of locations. By default \code{l = 1}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for each location. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) Names for each location.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with label list of treatments.}
}
\value{
A list with information on the design parameters.

Data frame with the split plot field book.

\description{
It randomly generates a split plot design (SPD) across locations.
