\title{Generates a Completely Randomized Design (CRD)}
\usage{
CRD(
  t = NULL,
  reps = NULL,
  plotNumber = 101,
  locationName = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{an integer number with total number of treatments or a vector of dimension t with labels.}

\item{reps}{Number of replicates (full blocks) of each treatment.}

\item{plotNumber}{Starting plot number. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{locationName}{(optional) Name of the location.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with the 2 columns with labels of each treatments and its number of replicates.}
}
\value{
A list with information on the design parameters.

Data frame with the CRD field book.
}
\description{
It randomly generates a completely randomized design.

# Example 1: Generates a CRD design with 10 treatments and 5 reps each.

# Example 2: Generates a CRD design with 15 treatments and 6 reps each.
