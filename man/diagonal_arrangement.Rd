\arguments{
\item{nrows}{Number of rows in the field.}

\item{ncols}{Number of columns in the field.}

\item{lines}{Number of genotypes, experimental lines or treatments.}

\item{checks}{Integer number of genotypes checks or a numeric vector.}

\item{planter}{Option for \code{serpentine} or \code{cartesian} plot arrangement. 
By default  \code{planter = 'serpentine'}.}

\item{l}{Number of locations or sites. By default  \code{l = 1}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for each location. 
By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{kindExpt}{Type of diagonal design, with options \code{'SUDC'} and \code{'DBUDC'}. 
By default \code{kindExpt = 'SUDC'}.}

\item{splitBy}{Option to split the field when \code{kindExpt = 'DBUDC'} is selected. 
By default \code{splitBy = 'row'}.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{blocks}{Number of experiments or blocks to generate an DBUDC design. 
If \code{kindExpt = 'DBUDC'} and data is null, \code{blocks} are mandatory.}

\item{exptName}{(optional) Name of the experiment.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) Names each location.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with 3 columns: \code{ENTRY | NAME | BLOCK} or only 2 
columns \code{ENTRY | NAME} if \code{kindExpt = 'SUDC'}.}
}
\value{
A list with information on the design parameters.

A matrix with the randomization layout.

A matrix with the layout plot number.

A data frame with fieldBook design. This includes the index (Row, Column).

\description{
Randomly generates an spatial un-replicated diagonal arrangement design.
}
\details{
Constructs for a field of an arbitrary number of rows and columns randomized single or multi-level experiments for an arbitrary number of
treatments \code{lines} and an arbitrary feasible number of checks. An arbitrary number of \code{checks} are allocated in a systematic diagonal movement.n un-replicated diagonal arrangement design  where the checks be allocated in 
a systematic diagonal movement. In most of the cases is guarantee that each row and column has 
checks. Note that design generation needs the dimension of the field (number of rows and columns).
