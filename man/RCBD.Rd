}
\arguments{
\item{t}{an integer number with total number of treatments or a vector of dimension t with labels.}

\item{reps}{Number of replicates (full blocks) of each treatment.}

\item{l}{Number of locations. By default \code{l = 1}.}

\item{plotNumber}{Numeric vector with the starting plot number for each location. By default \code{plotNumber = 101}.}

\item{continuous}{Logical value for plot number continuous or not. By default \code{continuous = FALSE}.}

\item{planter}{Option for \code{serpentine} or \code{cartesian} arrangement. By default \code{planter = 'serpentine'}.}

\item{seed}{(optional) Real number that specifies the starting seed to obtain reproducible designs.}

\item{locationNames}{(optional) Names for each location.}

\item{data}{(optional) Data frame with the labels of treatments.}
}
\value{
A list with information on the design parameters.

RCBD layout for each location.

plot number layout for each location.

Data frame with the RCBD field book.
}
\description{
It randomly generates a randomized complete block design (RCBD) across locations.

# Example 1: Generates a RCBD design with 3 blocks and 20 treatments across 3 locations.
