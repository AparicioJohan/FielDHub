\description{
Randomly generates an Alpha design like \code{alpha(0,1)} across multiple locations.
}
\details{
Alpha lattice designs are a type of replicated designs that divide the replicate into incomplete blocks 
that contain a fraction of the total number of entries. Treatments are distributed among the blocks so 
that all pairs occur in the same incomplete-block in nearly equal frequency. The design permits removal 
of incomplete-block effects from the plot residuals and maximizes the use of comparisons between treatments 
in the same incomplete-block. The \code{alpha_lattice} function can only be used to a number of treatments that 
are multiply of the size
